    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Not Chicken a la King, and not a chicken pot pie, but this is comfort food, nonetheless. Leftover chopped chicken joins some great veggies and a beautiful white sauce on fresh, hot biscuits. This recipe would be delicious over rice or noodles, too! I added some Worcestershire sauce for a little boost of umami flavor.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sherry</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water, or as needed</li>
        <li>⅓ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>¾ cup sliced carrots</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onions</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped celery</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped cooked chicken</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups frozen green peas</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>6 medium (blank)s biscuits, warmed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine chicken broth and sherry, and add enough water to make 2 cups of liquid. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat until bubbly. Add carrots, onions, and celery, and cook, stirring frequently, until the onions begin to soften and turn clear, 3 to 5 minutes. Carrots should be firm, but not crunchy. Stir in mushrooms, kosher salt, and pepper, and continue cooking for 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in flour and mix until all the liquid is incorporated in the flour, about 2 minutes. Mixture will be thick. Add chicken broth mixture, stirring quickly to avoid lumps. Stir in milk and cream and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove cover, stir in chopped chicken, frozen peas, and Worcestershire sauce. Increase heat to medium, bring to a boil, and cook, uncovered, about 5 minutes. Adjust salt and pepper, if necessary. If mixture becomes too thick, remove from heat and allow residual heat to cook the mixture for the remaining time. Stir in milk or water in 1-tablespoon increments to thin to the desired consistency.</li>
        <li>To serve, split open a biscuit and place on a plate or in a bowl. Ladle chicken mixture over the biscuit and garnish with parsley, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
